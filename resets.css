    THE CONTAINER ELEMENT
    The "container", sometimes referred to as a "section", is a container
    element (semantic when applicable) that vertically separates different
    areas on the page based on their purpose or topic. It can allow different
    background colors and properties for each section that help users associate
    content within it as belonging to the same subject.

/*
    THE ROW ELEMENT
    The "row" is a container element that horizontally separates its
    children, which are usually columns. It also performs a secondary role
    of keeping the content of the site within a reasonable width, so that
    wider screens don't disrupt the intended layout.

    THE COLUMN ELEMENT
    The "column" is a container element that vertically separates its

    it allows for the creation of a flexible grid system that can be used
    to create a variety of layouts.
